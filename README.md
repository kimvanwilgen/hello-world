In my role as Head of software development at ANVA I’m responsible for all software development. I’m an innovator and think out-of-the-box. When working on new topics or technologies I get passionate about it and drive change. With that passion, I’m able to move people and coach them in the transition with attention, feedback and humor. I learn quickly and can oversee things from different perspectives. I have in-depth knowledge of the financial services industry and a good overview of modern technologies and architectures in IT. Coping with the political environment of senior management comes natural to me and I can be persuasive, also for people who are higher in hierarchy. I use this to get things done as I’m particularly result oriented. 

I’m passionate about topics such as DevOps, continuous delivery, agile and continuous security, and the management of the cultural, organizational and technological changes associated with these approaches. I’m experienced in working agile with self-organized teams. I also supported and coached the transition from a traditional environment to the agile way of working as a senior manager. I believe in enabling people to thrive at work by being transparent and by empowering them, all to deliver value in the hands of the customer. 

Although a nerd at heart, I also have over a decade of experience in product development and comparable managerial roles on the other side: the business. I can understand the language of product owners and users to bridge the gap between IT and business.
